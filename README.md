# Physics Simulated Atari Asteroid Game
This project puts a twist on the classic arcade-style Asteroids Game where players navigate a spaceship, destroy asteroids, and strive for a high score. The game is implemented in Java and every interaction is simulated by physics laws and theorems, such as asteroid collisions obeying conservation of energy and momentum and kinematics.




## Features
- Responsive Controls: Use keyboard inputs to navigate the ship, fire bullets, and dodge asteroids
- Dynamic Gameplay: Procedurally generated asteroids with varying sizes and speeds
- Collision Mechanics: Realistic collision detection between the ship, bullets, and asteroids

- Score Tracking: Real-time score updates based on asteroid destruction
- Health System: Visual health bar and invulnerability period upon collision
- Asteroid Splitting: Larger asteroids split into smaller fragments when destroyed
- Game Over Handling: Display of final score with an end-game message

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE or text editor for Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Java Swing library (included with JDK)

## Installation
- Clone the repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/NomadicSasquatch/Asteroids.git
  cd Asteroids
  ```
- Open the project in your preferred IDE
- Ensure the necessary assets (asteroid sprite and custom font) are available

## How to Play
- Run the Main.java file to start the game
- Control your ship using:
  - W: Move forward
  - A/D: Rotate left/right
  - S: Move backward
  - Space: Fire bullets
- Avoid collisions with asteroids to survive
- Destroy asteroids to gain points
- Survive as long as possible and achieve a high score!
