# Physics Simulated Atari Asteroid Game
This project puts a twist on the classic arcade-style Asteroids Game where players navigate a spaceship, destroy asteroids, and strive for a high score. The game is implemented in Java and every interaction is simulated by real physics laws and theorems, such as asteroid collisions obeying conservation of energy and momentum and kinematics.

## Features
- Responsive Controls: Use keyboard inputs to navigate the ship, fire bullets, and dodge asteroids.
- Dynamic Gameplay: Procedurally generated asteroids with varying sizes and speeds.
- Collision Mechanics: Realistic collision detection between the ship, bullets, and asteroids.
- Score Tracking: Real-time score updates based on asteroid destruction.
- Health System: Visual health bar and invulnerability period upon collision.
- Asteroid Splitting: Larger asteroids split into smaller fragments when destroyed.
- Game Over Handling: Display of final score with an end-game message.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE or text editor for Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Java Swing library (included with JDK)

## Installation
- Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
- Open the project in your preferred IDE.
- Ensure the necessary assets (e.g., asteroid image and custom font) are available in the specified file paths.

## How to Play
- Run the Main.java file to start the game.
- Control your ship using:
W: Move forward
A/D: Rotate left/right
S: Move backward
Space: Fire bullets
- Avoid collisions with asteroids to survive.
- Destroy asteroids to gain points.
- Survive as long as possible and achieve a high score!
